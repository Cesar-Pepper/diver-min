# Diver Min

Diver Min is the final project of CS2110 making use of personally-created heaps, Djikstra's algorithm, dfs, and bfs. The game is minimally interactive and the "high score" is contingent on how effective the implemented algorithm is on a certain map seed. The game follows a sewer diver as he attempts to retrieve a gem in the fewest steps possible and to exit the sewer while collecting as many coins as possible, time (measured as steps) permitting. 

Not all code is original, only functions written in the student package are (with some minor exceptions). 

I have chosen not to include the original code due to the fact that instructor solutions to the instructor's implementation of Djikstra's algorithm and heaps have been posted with it. My work in no way takes influence from the instructor's solutions and were last modified before solutions were posted. The original handout has been included 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xrpt7SDBQgpR7gNKQD66W6k_FnsL2V1p/view?usp=sharing). 

Due to exporting errors, only a non-GUI version of the game could be exported into the [jar file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PXnaebEMoFEad62XK-zq8F1EqQUpb3Ts/view?usp=sharing). However, it is possible to clone the repository and play the game with the GUI. Gameplay can be seen viewed [here](https://gyazo.com/4f0483ffe0c1d6d0b64a9c0a6e8b039f) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6NDhrgJakZK_KpjRxaUQf5WgehkrANq/view?usp=sharing).

The code is not to be used in any way in violation of Cornell's Academic Integrity Policy.
